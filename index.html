    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        I would recommend to my client to consider security as a very serious act. It helps to protect your website from attacks and a variety threats. By a successful attack, the business can suffer a lot and losing money, customer information can be compromised, and  also losing the trust of customers.
There are several important threats to a website security, such as:
Cross-site scripting (XSS), which occurs when a malicious script successfully inserted and runs on a website, allowing an attacker to steal sensitive information from users.
 SQL injection, which involves sending malicious data into a website's database to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. 
 Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) where attackers trick users into performing actions on a website without their consent.
To deal with these and many other security threats we can apply some best practices which mentioned in OWASP Top 10. A few example like : 
Sanitization of data, the input data should be sanitized to remove any special characters or malicious code that could be used to attack the website. 
Secure authorization and authentication, strong authentication. By applying authorization users can only access the information and features that they are authorized to use. 
Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD), automated process that runs every code change through a series of automated tests and security checks. If the code changes pass all the tests and checks, they are automatically deployed to production. 
Implementation of session timeout for logged in users.
